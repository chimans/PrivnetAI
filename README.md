# PrivNet.AI - Privacy-Preserving Geometric Deep Learning

Welcome to **PrivNet.AI** — an open-source platform combining **post-quantum cryptography** and **geometric deep learning** to enable **privacy-preserving machine learning on sensitive data** such as genomics, financial networks, and healthcare records.

## 🚀 Project Vision
Build a privacy-centric infrastructure where users can train graph-based models **without ever decrypting their data**.

We use **isogeny-based cryptography** (post-quantum secure) and **graph neural networks (GNNs)** to perform secure, structure-aware learning on encrypted data.

---

## 🧩 Key Technologies
- **Post-Quantum Cryptography** using **Isogeny Graphs**
- **Graph Neural Networks** for structured data learning
- **SageMath** for elliptic curve operations
- **PyTorch Geometric / DGL** for GNN modeling
- **Federated Learning & Differential Privacy** (future integration)

## 🧠 Why this project matters?

Current ML systems expose data at many points: during training, inference, or transport. This is not acceptable for sensitive data (e.g., genome sequences, health records, financial transactions).

PrivNet.AI introduces a new paradigm: **Train on encrypted data. Analyze graphs with security. Scale with structure.**
